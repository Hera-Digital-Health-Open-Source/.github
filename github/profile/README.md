# Welcome

Welcome! (Hoş geldin! !مرحباً )

HERA (_Health Records App_) is an open-source mobile health (mHealth) platform designed to improve access to preventive health services for pregnant women and increase immunization rates among children under two, particularly in refugee communities worldwide.

## Our Mission

At HERA, we aim to bridge the healthcare gap for refugee populations by connecting them with essential healthcare services through a user-friendly mobile platform.

Thanks for stopping by! Here’s how to get started:

## Getting Started

HERA is an open-source project, and we’re excited to invite you to contribute! We have two main repositories open for contributions:

- **HERA Mobile App**: Built with **React Native**, this app provides a streamlined, intuitive interface for users seeking healthcare resources.

- **HERA Backend**: The backend is developed in **Python** and includes both the HERA’s Admin Panel and core web services to support data flow and manage healthcare resources effectively.

_Whether you’re a mobile developer, a backend specialist, or an enthusiast eager to learn, your skills are welcome here!_
